# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms in C++

This repository contains my custom implementations of fundamental **data structures** and selected **algorithms** in **C++**.  
All structures are written from scratch – without using STL containers – to better understand how they work under the hood.

## ⚙️ Implemented Structures

- 🔢 **Array List** – dynamic list using arrays
- 🔗 **Singly Linked List** – pointer-based list with basic operations
- 📥 **Stack** – LIFO structure implemented with both arrays and pointers
- 📤 **Queue** – FIFO structure (circular and linear implementations)
- 🕸️ **Graphs** – custom graph representation (adjacency list & adjacency matrix)

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Manual memory management
- Pointer manipulation and references
- Template programming (for generic structures)
- Time complexity awareness
- Clean code & modular design

## 🛠 Technologies

- Language: **C++ (17/20)**
- Platform: **Linux** (but code is cross-platform compatible)
- Build tools: `g++`, `make` (optional)
